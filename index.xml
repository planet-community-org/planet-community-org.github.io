I am restricted in the information I can release, so please, no emails or DMs asking for information. I thought, in light of the &amp;ldquo;Planet Embedded&amp;rdquo; XR-series that has been launched, it might be a good idea for me to explain my affiliation with the company behind it, the Gemini PDA, Cosmo Communicator, and their latest phone (but sadly not the latest SoC; this is a blessing in a way, more in future posts), Astro Slide 5G Transformer.</description>

      <description>(Initially posted here on my LinkedIn profile, but I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to move it to my blog, and tidy it up a bit.)
The idea is to use the cloud to play games (yes, I know - but this is a fun application of what could be used in the workplace professionally - it&amp;rsquo;s the fundamental skillls in cloud tech that are important here), all controlled with AWS Lambda functions, and using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy the setup.</description>

      <title>Seizure prediction: v1</title>

      <description>This post marks the beginning of a research project into seizure prediction.
I have generalised epilepsy, after two tonic-clonic fits I experienced in December 2017. They were both preceded by an aura, which I ignored, and continued on my commute. Ultimately, I ended up collapsing, having a seizure, and being taken to hospital.
I still have seizures, but these are mostly focal/absences/myoclonic. I&amp;rsquo;m worried when I leave the house on my own, and I find it difficult.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Dom. I&amp;rsquo;m a 20-something hobbyist programmer, advocate of open source/free software, and interested in electronics.
In terms of software, you can see my Github profile and my projects that I work on.
I do have a habit of starting projects, and then ending up with no time/motivation to work on it &amp;ndash; rest assured,that does not necessarily mean I&amp;rsquo;ve given up on them.
I&amp;rsquo;m also a hobbyist photographer, and enjoy taking landscape &amp;amp; candid photographs.</description>
